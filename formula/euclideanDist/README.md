The Euclidean Distance
======================

**Roadmap**
  1. Learn basic formula / concept ~ Euclidean Distance
  2. Create a function that computes the euclidean distance of a 2-Dimensional set
  4. Update the function so that it computes the euclidean distance on a N-Dimensional set (vector with N   length) ~ assuming all points on the vector pairs are the same length, with no empty values/points
  5. Set round euclidean distance value to the thousandth place
